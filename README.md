## Description

Developed the Back-End functionality for a Note-Taker App, that can be used to write and save notes.The app uses an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve user generated note data from a JSON file.

The applicationâ€™s front end has already been created. It's my job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the finished application to Heroku.


## User Story 

```
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```




# Features :

1. Used 'Express.js' to build server

2. Used 'fs(File System)' module to read and write from 'db.json' file.

3. Used [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) npm package to give unique id to each note.

4. Application is deployed on [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) : Heroku is a container-based cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS). Developers use Heroku to deploy, manage, and scale modern apps.
