## Description

Developed the Back-end functionality for a Note-Taker App, that can be used to write and save notes.The app uses an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve user generated note data from a JSON file.

The applicationâ€™s front end has already been created. It's my job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the finished application to Heroku.


## User Story
